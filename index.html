<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>
Unmanned aerial vehicles are now used in many different areas, but one problem still holds them back: their short flight time. Due to this, many researchers have started looking at solar power as a way to keep UAVs flying much longer. By placing lightweight solar cells on the wings or body, a drone can collect sunlight during flight and convert it into energy. Recent studies show that improvements in solar panels, aircraft materials and energy management systems have made long-endurance flights more realistic. Engineers are proposing new ways to design these aircraft, such as improving wing shape, reducing weight and planning flight paths that make better use of sunlight. Together, these developments suggest that solar-powered UAVs could become practical for long and continuous operations.
</p>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are gaining popularity in areas such as environmental monitoring, emergency response and communication support, but their usefulness is still limited by short battery life. Most small UAVs can only remain in the air briefly before needing to recharge. Researchers have been exploring solar energy as a way to extend flight duration, as sunlight provides a steady, renewable source of power (El-Atab et al., 2021; Sornek et al., 2025).
</p>
<p>
Solar-powered UAVs can produce electricity to run the motors or charge batteries by mounting solar cells onto their wings or fuselage. Recent studies show improvements in photovoltaic efficiency, lightweight structures and energy management strategies have made long endurance flights achievable. Engineering approaches such as optimising wing area and selecting suitable configurations for specific missions improve performance (Bakar et al., 2021). Additional techniques include storing excess solar energy or adjusting altitude during low light (Gao et al., 2023).

<h3>Wing Design and Structural Considerations</h3>
<p>
Wing structure is one of the most crucial factors influencing the performance of a solar-powered UAV. The wings must generate enough lift to support the aircraft while providing a large surface area for mounting solar cells. Research shows that long, slender wings reduce drag and improve aerodynamic efficiency, allowing the aircraft to fly at lower speeds with minimal power consumption (Bakar et al., 2021).
</p>
<p>
Engineers must ensure that wings remain lightweight yet strong enough to carry solar panels without bending excessively. Carbon fibre composites often achieve this balance. However, thin wings can become flexible under certain conditions, affecting stability and solar cell performance. This has led researchers to study aeroelastic behaviour to prevent unwanted deformation during flight (Cipolla et al., 2023).
</p>

<h3>Energy Generation and Management Strategies</h3>
<p>
Solar energy availability varies throughout the day, meaning effective energy management is essential for long-endurance flight. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electrical energy, which can power motors or charge batteries. During strong sunlight, excess energy can be stored for nighttime operation. 
</p>
<p>
Some studies highlight strategies such as climbing to higher altitudes during daylight and gliding down at night to conserve power (Gao et al., 2023). Advanced energy management systems distribute power efficiently across propulsion, avionics and communication systems, improving reliability in variable weather conditions.
</p>

<h3>Design Optimisation for Long Endurance Missions</h3>
<p>
Engineers increasingly rely on optimisation techniques during the design process. Computational tools allow testing of different wing shapes, structural materials, battery capacities and solar panel layouts before construction. Genetic algorithms have been used to identify wing geometries that maximise endurance (Bakar et al., 2021).
</p>
<p>
Multidisciplinary design optimisation (MDAO) integrates aerodynamics, structural performance and energy modelling into a single framework. This enables engineers to evaluate how adjustments in one part of the UAV affect the entire system (Li et al., 2020). Such optimisation improves energy efficiency and ensures components work together effectively.
